//! Forge client for live reads, resource keeping, and effect execution

//! Its state is the bounded working set, request budget, and in-flight write
//! lanes. It never knows task policy, grants, subscribers, or the top's durable
//! outbox. `step` accepts parent events, `fire` handles deadlines, and `resume`
//! sends eligible calls. The parent commits progress and outcomes before it
//! releases the calls produced by the same decision.
