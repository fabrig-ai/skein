//! What happened on the forge, content and all, for a referee
//! (testing-strategy.md, section 7): every change a call, CI or another party
//! made, in a bounded queue a world drains at its own pace.
//!
//! A refused write or git call is observed too, so that a referee sees what
//! a client tried that the forge kept from happening: a merge its protection
//! refused, a stale head, a push that was not a fast-forward.
//!
//! Observations are outside the boundary: they are not requests, take no room
//! in `out`, and when the queue is full they are dropped and counted. Nothing
//! the forge does depends on whether one was kept. A world's setup is not
//! observed.
